## The Project

The first task is to make the index.html page. This is the first page that someone will see when
viewing the website and will be where the links for the other pages will go. The first part of
the page to make is the overall style and theme that will also be used for the other pages.

I will keep the Google Material design in mind throughout the process of designing my own webpage
as this will make it work together and look more professional. I have started by making the nav
bar, which has four buttons on it for the Home, CV, Bio and contact pages. The tab for the current
page will have either a block colour or underline to signify it being active.

The next step is to make the footer. I decided to keep the colour of the footer white like the body
of the page but have given it a shadow to separate it. I have also decided that his would be a good
idea for the nav bar, this way it will stick to the idea of layering sections on top of each other
rather than a 2D sheet. Further keeping to the 3D effect, I have now added a overlaying body section
to the main page allowing for this to have a shadow to it as well. This is enhanced by changing the
main page to a light grey.

Now this is done, I have changed the colour of the nav bar to give it a more appealing look but still
staying to the material design by choosing a main colour with an accompanying accent colour.

Now that the main styling of the page is complete I am able to use it on all the other pages as well.
This makes it easier for me now to add the content of the pages and work around the style that is now
implemented.
