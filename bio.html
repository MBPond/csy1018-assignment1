            <p>
                While growing up I have always been interested in motorcycles. It has become a hobby of mine to ride motorbikes but are very useful in commuting to college and work. I aim to continue improving my skills in riding and eventually get a full unrestricted
                license. Once i have acheived this I wish to go on a trip through Europe with a couple of friends who also are passionate about riding bikes.

            <p>
                Another interest of mine is gaming, this includes computer, board and card games. I feel that through playing games I learn things that i otherwise wouldnt have. Such as historical events, social skills and has also helped in improving my design skills.
